## Overview ‚è©Ô∏è

CloudMesh is a Python tool that maps Cloudflare domains and subdomains to Hetzner Cloud servers across multiple projects. It fetches data from the Cloudflare and Hetzner APIs, matches domains to servers by IP addresses, and generates detailed HTML and PDF reports. This tool is ideal for infrastructure management, helping you track and clean up your cloud resources by providing a clear overview of your domain-to-server relationships.

## Core Features ‚ú®

- **Comprehensive Mapping:** Links Cloudflare A records (domains and subdomains) to Hetzner servers, showing project, server name, IP, status, creation date, server type, monthly price, traffic usage, and labels.
- **Domain-Specific Tables:** Organizes data into separate tables for each domain, with subdomains sorted alphabetically.
- **Visual Clarity:** Highlights unmatched IPs (where no Hetzner server is found) in red for easy identification.
- **Summary Statistics:** Displays total domains, A records, matched servers, and total monthly spending (‚Ç¨) at the top of the report.
- **Dual Output Formats:** Generates both an HTML report (`reports/mapping.html`) for browser viewing and a timestamped PDF report (e.g., `reports/mapping_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.pdf`) for archiving or sharing.
- **Extensible Design:** Built to support future enhancements like monitoring and automation.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.6+:** Ensure Python is installed (`python3 --version`).
- **Dependencies:**
  - Python packages: `requests`, `pdfkit`, `prometheus_client` (`pip install requests pdfkit prometheus_client`).
  - System tool: `wkhtmltopdf` for PDF generation.
    - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install wkhtmltopdf`
    - macOS: `brew install wkhtmltopdf`
    - Windows: Download from [wkhtmltopdf.org](https://wkhtmltopdf.org) and add to PATH.
- **API Tokens:**
  - Cloudflare: Create a token with `Zone:Read` and `DNS:Read` permissions for all zones (Cloudflare Dashboard).
  - Hetzner: Generate a Read & Write token for each project (Hetzner Cloud Console).

### Setup

#### 1. Install Python Dependencies

- Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- Install required Python packages:
  ```bash
  pip install requests pdfkit prometheus_client
  ```
- Install wkhtmltopdf:
  - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install wkhtmltopdf`
  - macOS: `brew install wkhtmltopdf`
  - Windows: Download from [wkhtmltopdf.org](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html) and add to PATH

#### 2. Install and Run Prometheus, Pushgateway, and Grafana

**Option A: Docker (Recommended)**

> **Note:** When running Prometheus and Pushgateway in Docker, `localhost` does not work between containers. Use a user-defined Docker network and container names for connectivity.

```bash
# Create a Docker network for monitoring tools
docker network create monitoring

# Start Pushgateway on the network with a name
docker run -d --name pushgateway --network monitoring -p 9091:9091 prom/pushgateway

# Start Prometheus on the same network with a name and config volume
docker run -d --name prometheus --network monitoring -p 9090:9090 -v $PWD/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml prom/prometheus

# Start Grafana on the same network with a name
docker run -d --name grafana --network monitoring -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana
```

Update your `prometheus.yml` to use the Pushgateway container name:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'cloudmesh_pushgateway'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['pushgateway:9091']
```

**Option B: Manual Installation**
- [Prometheus Download](https://prometheus.io/download/)
- [Pushgateway Download](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/#pushgateway)
- [Grafana Download](https://grafana.com/grafana/download)

#### 3. Configure CloudMesh

- Set the following environment variables (in your shell, .env file, or CI/CD secrets):

  - `CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN`: Cloudflare API token with `Zone:Read` and `DNS:Read` permissions.
  - `HETZNER_TOKEN_1`, `HETZNER_PROJECT_NAME_1`: Hetzner API token and project name for each project (add more as needed: `HETZNER_TOKEN_2`, etc.).
  - `PUSHGATEWAY_URL`: URL of your Prometheus Pushgateway (e.g., `http://pushgateway:9091` or `http://localhost:9091`).

  Example `.env` file:
  ```
  CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN=your_cloudflare_token
  HETZNER_TOKEN_1=your_hetzner_token
  HETZNER_PROJECT_NAME_1=your_project_name
  PUSHGATEWAY_URL=http://pushgateway:9091
  ```

  If running in CI/CD, set these as repository secrets.

---

### Docker Networking Troubleshooting

- If Prometheus cannot connect to Pushgateway, ensure both containers are on the same Docker network and use the container name (not `localhost`) in `prometheus.yml`.
- Restart Prometheus after any configuration changes.
- To check connectivity, you can run a shell in the Prometheus container and ping the Pushgateway:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it prometheus sh
  ping pushgateway
  ```
- If you run your script outside Docker, use `localhost:9091` for Pushgateway in `config.json`. If inside Docker, use `pushgateway:9091`.

### Monitoring and Dashboard Access

#### A. Accessing Prometheus

- Once Prometheus is running, open [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090) in your browser.
- Use the "Status" ‚Üí "Targets" menu to verify that the Pushgateway is listed and metrics are being scraped.
- You can query metrics directly from the Prometheus web UI.

#### B. Accessing Grafana

- Once Grafana is running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
- **Default login:**  
  - Username: `admin`  
  - Password: `admin` (you will be prompted to change this on first login)
- After login:
  1. Go to "Configuration" ‚Üí "Data Sources" ‚Üí "Add data source".
  2. Select "Prometheus" and set the URL to `http://prometheus:9090`.
  3. Save & Test the data source.
  4. Go to "Dashboards" ‚Üí "Import" and upload `grafana-dashboard.json` from the repo.
  5. Open the imported dashboard to view CloudMesh metrics.

- **Security Note:** Change the Grafana admin password after your first login.

#### C. Running the Script and Workflow

- Ensure the required environment variables are set as described above.
- Run the script:
  ```bash
  python script.py
  ```
- The script will:
  - Generate HTML and PDF reports in the `reports/` directory.
  - Push monitoring metrics (run count, duration, domains, records, errors, etc.) to the Prometheus Pushgateway.

#### D. How It All Works Together

1. `script.py` runs and pushes metrics to the Pushgateway.
2. Prometheus scrapes the Pushgateway and stores metrics.
3. Grafana visualizes these metrics using the provided dashboard.

#### E. Example Workflow

1. Start Prometheus, Pushgateway, and Grafana (see above).
2. Run `python script.py` to generate reports and metrics.
3. Open Prometheus ([http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)) to verify metrics.
4. Open Grafana ([http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)), add Prometheus as a data source, and import the dashboard.
5. View real-time metrics and visualizations in Grafana.



### Usage

- **Run the Script:**
  ```bash
  python script.py
  ```
  This generates:
  - `reports/mapping.html`: An HTML report viewable in any web browser.
  - `reports/mapping_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.pdf`: A timestamped PDF report for archiving or sharing.

- **View the Reports:**
  - **HTML:** Open `reports/mapping.html` in a browser (e.g., `open reports/mapping.html` on macOS, `xdg-open reports/mapping.html` on Linux, or `start reports/mapping.html` on Windows).
  - **PDF:** Open the latest PDF file in `reports/` using a PDF viewer.

- **Report Details:**
  - **Summary Table:** Shows total domains, A records, matched servers, and monthly spending.
  - **Domain Tables:** Each domain has its own table listing subdomains, IPs, projects, server names, status, creation dates, server types, prices, traffic, and labels.
  - **Unmatched IPs:** Highlighted in red for easy identification.

## Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana

CloudMesh supports real-time monitoring via Prometheus and Grafana.

### Usage: Accessing Prometheus & Grafana

#### Prometheus

1. Start Prometheus and your script as described in the setup.
2. Open [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090) in your browser.
3. In the top menu, click **Status** ‚Üí **Targets**.
   - Confirm that the Pushgateway is listed as a target and its state is **UP**.
4. To check for metrics:
   - Click **Graph** or **Explore**.
   - Enter a metric name such as `cloudmesh_script_runs_total` and click **Execute**.
   - If you see data, Prometheus is receiving metrics from your script.
5. **Troubleshooting:**  
   - If you see no targets or metrics, ensure Prometheus is running with the correct `prometheus.yml` and that your script has pushed metrics to the Pushgateway.

#### Grafana

1. Start Grafana as described in the setup.
2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
3. Log in with the default credentials:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin` (you will be prompted to change this on first login)
4. In the left sidebar, click the **gear icon (Configuration)** ‚Üí **Data Sources** ‚Üí **Add data source**.
5. Select **Prometheus**.
6. In the **HTTP** section, set the URL to `http://localhost:9090`.
7. Click **Save & Test**. You should see "Data source is working".
8. In the left sidebar, click the **four squares icon (Dashboards)** ‚Üí **Import**.
9. Click **Upload JSON file** and select `grafana-dashboard.json` from your project directory.
10. Assign the imported dashboard to the Prometheus data source you just created.
11. Click **Import**. The dashboard should now display CloudMesh metrics.
12. **Troubleshooting:**  
    - If the dashboard is empty, ensure your script has run and metrics are present in Prometheus.
    - Double-check that the correct data source is selected for the dashboard panels.

**Security Note:**  
Change the Grafana admin password after your first login for security.

### How it works

- Each run of `script.py` pushes metrics (run count, duration, domains, records, errors, etc.) to a Prometheus Pushgateway.
- Prometheus scrapes the Pushgateway and stores metrics.
- Grafana visualizes these metrics using the provided dashboard.

### Setup

1. **Install Prometheus, Pushgateway, and Grafana** (Docker example):

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 9090:9090 -v $PWD/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml prom/prometheus
   docker run -d -p 9091:9091 prom/pushgateway
   docker run -d -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana
   ```

2. **Configure Pushgateway URL**

   Set the `PUSHGATEWAY_URL` environment variable:

   ```
   PUSHGATEWAY_URL=http://localhost:9091
   ```

3. **Run the script**

   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```

   Metrics will be pushed to the Pushgateway after each run.

4. **Import the Grafana Dashboard**

   - Open Grafana at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - Add Prometheus as a data source (URL: `http://localhost:9090`)
   - Import `grafana-dashboard.json` from the repo

### Metrics Collected

- Script runs, errors, run duration
- Domains, A records, matched servers, unmatched IPs

### Example Prometheus config

See `prometheus.yml` in the repo.


- **Prometheus and Grafana Integration:** Add real-time monitoring with Prometheus to collect server metrics (e.g., CPU, memory, actual traffic) and visualize them in Grafana dashboards for a dynamic, at-a-glance view.
- **Accurate Traffic Data:** Integrate Hetzner‚Äôs Robot Webservice or server logs to fetch real-time network traffic, replacing the current placeholder.
- **Automated Cleanup:** Add functionality to power off or delete unused servers directly via the Hetzner API, based on criteria like low traffic or age.
- **Interactive Reports:** Enhance the HTML report with sorting, filtering, and search capabilities using JavaScript.
- **Extended DNS Support:** Include other DNS record types (e.g., CNAME, MX) to provide a complete DNS-to-server mapping.
- **Notifications:** Send alerts (via email or Slack) for unmatched IPs or servers needing attention (e.g., high cost, low usage).
- **Multi-Provider Support:** Expand to map domains to servers from other providers (e.g., AWS, DigitalOcean).

These enhancements can be prioritized based on your needs, making CloudHetznerSync a robust tool for infrastructure management.
